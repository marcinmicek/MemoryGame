Implementation of a simple memory game according

Hello, my name is Marcin Micek.
Coding is for me a chance to change something in my professional career.
I like challenges and in my current job there's not much of it.
Coding gives me opportunity to confront with various tasks, often difficult.
Moreover, coding let's me think creatively.
It's not "using" but "creating" things.
This is what I love in it.
